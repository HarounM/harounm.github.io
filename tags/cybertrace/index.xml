It held a multitude of conferences and workshops alongside an on-site CTF at night. And I had the honor to be one of the trainers that animated one of the aforementioned workshops. So, as many attendees asked me to, I&amp;rsquo;m writing this walkthrough to collect and preserve the knowledge shared through the workshop. Plus, I&amp;rsquo;m hoping this becomes something of use for people wanting to dive in the forensics field as I didn&amp;rsquo;t find as many well-maintained ressources as i wished while preparing it.</description></item></channel></rss>
